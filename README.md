# Welcome!

## What is Taraxa?

Taraxa is a purpose-built, fast, scalable, and device-friendly public ledger designed to help businesses make better and more responsive decisions. 

## Why build Taraxa?

It is our firm belief that technologies are meant to solve real world problems, and cannot be developed in isolation. The applications we build, will build, and will enable our community to build, will \(and do\) have concrete functionality implications to how the public ledger infrastructural layer is designed and implemented. To this end, the application and the ledger need to be tightly coupled to create the most optimized outcomes. 

This is why we created Taraxa, a purpose-built public ledger to enable us to specifically solve challenges caused by friction in business coordination & decision-making processes.
