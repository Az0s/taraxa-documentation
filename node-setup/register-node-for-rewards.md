# Register Node For Rewards

{% hint style="warning" %}
This step requires you have obtained you nodes public account address.  If you haven't already, [first follow the instructions on finding your running node's address](node_address.md).
{% endhint %}

Login to the the [Community Site](https://community.taraxa.io/) and click on **RUN a node** in the Testnet tab to register your node's public address.   This way we know the node belongs to your community account and incentives can be rewarded.
