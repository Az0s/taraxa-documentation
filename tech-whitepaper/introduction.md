## 1.1 The Promise of IoT

Long has the prospect of billions upon billions of intelligent, connected, and autonomous devices freely communicating and coordinating with one another been held up as an unquestioned vision for the future. The confluence and rapid advancement of technologies such as ever-more precise sensors and actuators, cloud computing, and near-ubiquitous connectivity have all made this vision seem increasingly likely. The market is full of audacious predictions of the world full of trillions of connected devices and the market for IoT reaching hundreds of trillions of dollars in market size.

Yet, with each passing year, that promise has remained just that, a promise.

For IoT to fully realize its promised potential, we would require a far more rapid pace in collecting and sharing of that collected data. IoT’s core value lies in the insights generated from the data collected by devices, which then in turn enable devices and humans to act upon these insights to generate value, eventually driving towards completely autonomous behaviors. As it stands today, the rate at which new data is being collected is slow, and the rate of sharing \(and trading\) of data is glacial. While by and large the sector has moved beyond the basic “what is IoT” understanding gap, it is nevertheless being held back by a set of very practical obstacles.

**Technical obstacles** Existing IoT infrastructures face a myriad of challenges as they scale up and eventually reaches trillions of autonomous devices. Centralized governance systems are ill-equipped to handle security as they present a single point of failure, they tend to scale poorly with workload as most device to device interactions tend to be localized, data collected by devices face questions of authenticity and provenance, and manufacturers in an attempt to create moats around their markets intentionally build in incompatible communication standards resulting in huge numbers of fragmented silos that take herculean costs and efforts to integrate.

**Business obstacles** Due to the fundamental nascent nature of IoT systems as well as the various technical challenges, business cases for deploying large-scale IoT networks are often difficult to justify. The effort to discover financially-sound business cases are often hampered by data sensitivities tied to a fear of leaking trade know-how. Finally, with the rise of mega platforms and infrastructure players, businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the strategic risk of tying themselves into these centralized gardened walls, leaving them with a significantly-weakened bargaining position.

**Social obstacles** With the rapid proliferation of digitized technologies, the public at large has become increasingly aware of the omnipresence of data-collecting sensors as well as concerned about how they’re being used. Recent data leaking scandals [\[1\]]() [\[2\]]() and the EU’s GDPR [\[3\]]() have all placed privacy and data ownership at the center of civil discourse. If IoT as a technology is to continue proliferation, it must address data privacy concerns head-on and provide socially-acceptable solutions to guarantee secure data ownership and usage without triggering innovation-killing regulatory backlashes.

These and many more obstacles prevent the rapid adoption and value actualization of IoT in general.

## 1.2 How Blockchain Technology Could Help

Blockchain technology \(for this section the term blockchain is used to refer generally to decentralized ledger technologies\) has given us a tool for a decentralized set of participants to collaborate, trade, and compete without preestablished trust, radically diminishing or in many cases completely removing the need for centralized systems to provide guarantees and coordination. This decentralization has several interesting consequences as applicable to IoT.

**Fractionalizing Resources** Decentralization enables society at large to unlock underutilized assets such as storage, bandwidth, and computing power. Think of it like a shared economy without the centralized platform \(shared riding without Uber, shared rooms without Airbnb\), where idle resources could be more fully leveraged. This type of sharing also has the added effect of lowering the minimum purchase size for the individual or the small business owners, for whom in the past setting up an IoT infrastructure is prohibitively expensive.

**Decentralized Security and Responsibility** No longer are centralized coordination authorities necessary to facilitate transactions or maintenance updates. Blockchain enables fully decentralized networks \(without single points of failure\) that is far more secure and transparent. Hacking a single device wouldn’t get you access to a million IoT devices, just one, and the rest of the network hums along, significantly raising overall network security. Each device and device owner are now masters of their own device, its security, and the data it produces, making network maintenance a far more manageable task.

**Open Source Ecosystem**  
One of the core features of public ledger ecosystems is that the underlying technology is all open-source, without which participants cannot be sure to trust the code that runs the ecosystem. This type of open-source ecosystem not only minimizes the risk of becoming platform-dependent \(anyone can replicate the ecosystem at any given time if they choose to do so\). For IoT data owners who may be reluctant to rely upon external platforms for mission-critical analytics, they can be sure that platform is fully decentralized, transparent, and free for anyone to duplicate, should they find any part of the ecosystem to their dissatisfaction.

**Democratization of Data** Blockchain can eventually enable devices to trade data with one another, enabling the much-heralded machine-to-machine economy. In time this economy will develop its own assets, pricing and reputations, each device its own business. With more sophisticated AI even generate its own algorithms to make use of the data available to maximize its own interests. By democratizing data, innovation \(and business cases\) would more readily and spontaneously blossom as ever more participants are granted access.

Integrating blockchain technology into IoT would prove a significant boon to the space, enabling more data to be more freely shared and traded, triggering an explosive emergence of hitherto unthought-of applications.
